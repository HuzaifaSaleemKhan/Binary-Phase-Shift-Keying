# Binary-Phase-Shift-Keying
Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is a digital modulation technique in telecommunications. It encodes binary data as shifts in the phase of a carrier wave. In BPSK, one phase represents 0, and the opposite phase represents 1, making it a simple and efficient way to transmit digital information over a communication channel.
